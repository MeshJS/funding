# Milestone Report

Hey there Milestone Reviewer, voters and everyone following the progress of this proposal.
We are glad to report on the successful completion of the first milestone of this proposal.


The acceptance criteria of this milestone have been stated as:

- Hydra Provider Integration: Establish a connection with a Hydra node.
- Base Functionality: Develop foundational functions to support Hydra processes across its key phases: Open, Commit, Close, and Fanout.


And here is the evidence of Milestone completion, including all relevant links to assess and audit our work.



The entire Hydra package is done and is available at 
https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/tree/feat-hydra-to-beta/packages/hydra . 

When published, users can install it using `npm install @meshsdk/hydra`.

The Hydra Provider is
