## Milestone 5 Report

	
Et voila, here we are with the final Milestone completion, successfully closing the Proposal. Let's make this close out short and concise :) 

The two outputs of the final milestone have been:

Overall reflections and analysis on the Proposal performance via a detailed close out report and video

Summary

The proposal enabled us to

Reward mesh open source tools & libraries maintenance
Mesh Discord maintenance and moderation
Organise and host online events & coding sessions
Engage Mesh PBL creators & contributors
Onboarding new developers
Increase our know-how and dec capacities with the Mesh Team
The reflections and analysis of the proposal performance, including the close out report & video has been successfully completed and can be found at:

Since the initial close out video has not been approved by milestone reviewers, we created an additional video with more details. (Tho we hope that reviewers understand the we are a developer project, and not a marketing studio*). Here the redone close out video:*

Number of participating developers in course modules and lessons and completed lessons:

The Mesh PBL https://pbl.meshjs.dev/ is launched and we have at the time of writing this report 42 minted contributor tokens which can be verified on chain at: https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/tokenPolicy/2338f623197e6db983612da0a74baeac62ffd693d454785108c26b5f . 

In total, we have 8 modules and 34 lessons on which learners can test and learn their knowledge.

As the PBL is running, we will observe how it goes and for the future, address following thoughts:

Still need to see how successful the course is longer term:

will new developers find and use it?
how will it be kept up-to-date (eg, upon release of Mesh 2. or how about Mesh 3?)
Related to above - we still have not broken outside of the Cardano bubble -- true success of this project is in the future - will we expand this dev ecosystem or stay at current state?
